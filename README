To install LaTeX-Make system-wide or on an user account, please refer to
the INSTALL file.


The LaTeX-Make software can also be installed within the directory of a
LaTeX document. This is usefull if your document is under SVN or Git and if
some users did not installed LaTeX-Make.

So, if you LaTeX document is in the $DIR directory, you need to copy, at
least:
* LaTeX.mk in $DIR
* texdepends.sty and figlatex.sty in $DIR
* gensubfig.py, svg2dev.py, svgdepth.py, figdepth.py, gensubfig.py, and
  latexfilter.py in $DIR/bin or $DIR

This can be done by creating a Makefile with 'include LaTeX.mk' in it and
using the 'LaTeX-Make-local-install' Make target.
