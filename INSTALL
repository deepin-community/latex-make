INSTALLATION:
=============

Full installation:
------------------
  Prefer a package from your distribution if available
  ("apt-get install latex-make" on Debian/Ubuntu)

  Manual Installation: Basic Steps
  ********************************
  1) get the sources (tar.gz) and unpack them
  2) go to the new directory and type:
       ./configure
       # You will get the list of all configurated TDS on your system
       # Choose the one that fit you best, generally something in
       # /usr/local without suffix such as -dist, -config, -var, ...
       # for example, most MacOS X should select /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local
       # For PREFIX, the default /usr/local is generally correct
       [edit config.mk if selected default values are wrong]
       make
       make check    # optional
       [sudo] make install

  Manual Installation: Detailled Information
  ******************************************
  This package installs:
  * TeX files in $(texmf_prefix) 
    a standard TDS is assumed here: see http://www.tug.org/twg/tds/
    (with scripts in $(texmf_prefix)/scripts/latex-make)
  * a symbolic link for the Makefile snipset in $(prefix)/include
    (to $(texmf_prefix)/scripts/latex-make)
  
  Default values are generated by the configure script and stored into
  the config.mk file that you can edit.
  
  You can make a default install with:
  make install
  
  To install LaTeX-Make conforming to the FHS, you can type:
  ./configure --prefix=/usr --texmf-prefix= && make install
  
  To install in HOME directory, you can use:
  ./configure --prefix=$HOME --texmf-prefix=$HOME/texmf && make install
  In this case, to not forget to invoke make(1) with the '-I' option:
  make -I${HOME}/include ...
  
  If you want to install the required files in a directory containing a LaTeX
  document (so that compiling in this directory does not need the installation
  of this package), please refers to the README file.

  The provided 'configure' script will list the currently configurated
  TDS in your system. You can use it to choose a correct TDS.
    For example, MacOS X users using texlive will probably choose
  /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local

Building main files:
--------------------
  If you just want to get main files (Makefile snipset, scripts and LaTeX
  style), go to the src/ directory and type 'make' (or 'make doc' if you
  also want the documentation)

  The example/ directory contains a very small example of what can be done with
  this software. [to be improved, patches welcome]


REQUIREMENTS:
=============

General:
--------

  In order to work, LaTeX Make requires:
  - GNU Make (>= 3.81)
    type "make --version" to check
  - a relatively recent LaTeX distribution (teTeX 3.0 should work,
    TeXLive >= 2005 also)
  
  If using figlatex, LaTeX Make also needs:
  - inkscape (>= 0.48.2) for converting svg files
  - transfig (>= 3.2.4) for the fig2dev command
    type "transfig -V" to check
  - ghostscript that is called by fig2dev
    type "gs --version" to check
  
Notes for MacOS X users:
------------------------
[I'm not sure these notes are up-to-date. Patches welcome]

  make 3.81
  *********
  make 3.81 is included at least with XCode 4 and 10.6 Snow Leopard. Otherwise,
  you need to install it with MacPorts, Fink or to manually recompile it. The
  latter is easy:
  1) get the sources (tar.gz) and unpack them
  2) go to the new directory and type:
       ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
       make
       sudo make install
  3) add /usr/local/bin in your PATH
  
  Note that you can choose another prefix if you like (for example
  /usr/local/make-3.81). Setup your PATH accordingly in this case.
  
  inkscape 0.48.2
  ***************
  Inkscape can be downloaded from the official site (http://inkscape.org/).
  However, the binary must be in the path. An easy way is to create a file
  /usr/bin/inkscape (don't forget to chmod a+x this file) with: 
#!/bin/sh
/Applications/Inkscape.app/Contents/Resources/bin/inkscape $*



  teTeX
  *****
  teTeX can be installed with the Darwin port[1].
  Note: the installer requires that /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.local
  is a valid TeX Directory Structure[2]. This is the case with the
  Darwin port.

  A very simple way to install a complete LaTeX distribution is to 
  install MacTex (http://www.tug.org/mactex/). LaTeX addons are located in
  ~/Library/texmf.
  
  transfig
  ********
  The transfig package in the stable fink[3] distribution is compiled
  with an deprecated option. In consequence, fig2dev uses \epsfig
  instead of \includegraphics in its generated files.
  One of the three workaround can be used:
  1) add \let\epsfig=\includegraphics at the begining of your document
     (just after the \begin{document})
     Of course, this will not work if you were using the deprecated
     epsfig package.
  2) use the transfig-graphicx package from the unstable fink[3]
     distribution
  3) recompile the transfig package without "DDEPSFIG = -DEPSFIG"
     (look in the applied patch and remove the removal of XCOMM for the
     line "XCOMM DDEPSFIG = -DEPSFIG" for the file fig2dev/Imakefile)
  
  ghostscript
  ***********
  The ghostscript package can be found in the stable fink[3]
  distribution.
